# For AWS server to load virtual environment and nvm on reboot

source server/venv/bin/activate

# Something is wrong with nvm installation on AWS currently; these commands need to be run manually each time a shell instance is started 

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
