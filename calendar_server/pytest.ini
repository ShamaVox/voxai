[pytest]
# Automatically load environment variables from .env file for tests
# Requires python-dotenv to be installed (`pip install python-dotenv`)
# Note: pytest-dotenv plugin might be needed if this doesn't work directly
# Alternatively, manage env vars manually or via fixtures.
# Example using pytest-dotenv:
# addopts = --doctest-modules
# env_files =
#     .env

# Optional: Define markers for organizing tests
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks integration tests (require external systems or multiple components)
    unit: marks unit tests (focus on single functions/classes)

# Optional: Set default Flask environment for tests
env =
    FLASK_ENV=testing

# Tell pytest where to find tests
testpaths = tests

# Ignore warnings from dependencies if needed (use with caution)
# filterwarnings =
#     ignore::DeprecationWarning
